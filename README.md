## **Overview of Analysis**

### ***Purpose***

The purpose of this project is to utilize a variety of machine learning models to determine which model is the best at assessing credit risk for LendingClub.

*Technologies used: Python, Jupyter Notebook*

## **Results**

In this project, I deployed a number of machine learning models to predict credit risk. The following models were utilized along with images to illustrate the results.

* Random Over Sampler

  *balanced accuracy score is 64.5%
  *high risk precision is 1% with 61% sensitivity which yields an F1 score of 2%.
  *Given the large number of thw low risk population, its precision is 100% with a sensitivity of 68%
